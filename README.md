Telecom Churn Prediction using Machine Learning models

Telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this repo, we will have 3 main goals.

Analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm.
Build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn
Identify the main indicators of churn.
